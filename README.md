The computation we have choses for this program is returning the factors of integers given by a user for example if the user input gave 
7,15,20 the program would return 7: 1,7 15: 1,3,5,15 20: 1,2,4,5,10,20 with the option for the user to set custome delimiters between 
the numbers and their factors\
